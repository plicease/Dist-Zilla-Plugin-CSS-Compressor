=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CSS::Compressor - Compress CSS files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 [CSS::Compressor]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Compress CSS files in your distribution using L<CSS::Compressor>.  By default for
each C<foo.css> file in your distribution this plugin will create a C<foo.min.css>
which has been compressed.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 finder

Specifies a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> for the CSS files that
you want compressed.  If this is not specified, it will compress all the CSS
files that do not have a C<.min.> in their filenames.  Roughly equivalent to
this:

 [FileFinder::ByName / CSSFiles]
 file = *.css
 skip = .min.
 [CSS::Compressor]
 finder = CSSFile

=head2 output_regex

Regular expression substitution used to generate the output filenames.  By default
this is

 [CSS::Compressor]
 output_regex = /\.css$/.min.css/

which generates a C<foo.min.css> for each C<foo.css>.

=head2 output

Output filename.  Not used by default, but if specified, all CSS files are merged and
compressed into a single file using this as the output filename.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $plugin-E<gt>gather_files( $arg )

This method adds the compressed CSS files to your distribution.
